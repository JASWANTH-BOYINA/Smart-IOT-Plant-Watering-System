# Smart-IOT-Plant-Watering-System

## Project Overview

This project presents an **Automated Plant Watering System** using the **ESP8266 Microcontroller**, designed to monitor and manage soil moisture levels, enhancing plant care through precise irrigation control. The system integrates soil moisture sensors to detect real-time moisture levels, sending data to the ESP8266 board. When the soil moisture drops below a set threshold, we will activate the water pump through blink interface, ensuring plants receive adequate water.
Additionally, the system is IoT-enabled, allowing users to monitor and control the watering process remotely via blynk interface application. This is efficient, low-cost system helps reduce water waste and labor by only watering plants when needed, making it ideal for both residential and commercial applications. The project emphasizes sustainable gardening practices through automated irrigation, leveraging IoT to achieve smarter plant care solutions.
